<p><B> <h1>Chilli Paneer Recipe (Spicy Indo Chinese Style)</h2></p>
<p><h3>Chilli Paneer is one of the most popular recipes in Indo-Chinese cuisine.<p> 
It is simply flour or batter coated fried paneer cubes tossed in a spicy, salty,<p> 
tangy and sweet sauce made with green bell peppers, garlic, ginger, green chillies, soy sauce and more seasonings.<p> 
There are three primary ways of making it, including dry, semi dry or gravy versions.<p> 
In this post I am sharing the semi-dry (restaurant style) version alongside step-by-step photos and video.</h3></P>

<h1> What is Chilli Paneer </h1>
<p> Chilli Paneer is a vegetarian version of Chilli Chicken and has become one of the most sought after dishes in Indo-Chinese cuisine.<p>
 I have been told that it tastes similar to General Tso’s recipe, though it is made with Indian cottage cheese instead of tofu.<p>

In a typical Chilli Paneer recipe,
the paneer cubes are coated with either a thin dusting of flour or are batter coated prior to being fried.
The fried cheese cubes are then tossed in a sweet, sour and spicy sauce that is, as the Americans say, “finger-licking good.” </p>
<p><h2><Chilli Paneer can be served in one of three ways:<p>

1)The dry version of chilli paneer is served as a starter.<p>
2)The gravy version is usually served with steamed rice or noodles.<p>
3)The semi-dry version can be enjoyed as either an appetizer or entrée, and in my opinion is the most authentic restaurant-style taste and flavor of the three.<p>
This chilli paneer recipe is awesome for serving with noodles or fried rice, naan or roti.</h2></p>
