<p><strong>Idli sambar</strong> The idli sambar is a North indian Recipe Famouse recipe
<p><b>Serving :- </b>
<p><em>Since plain idlis are mild in taste, a condiment is considered essential.</em></P>
<p>Idlis are often served with chutneys (coconut based), sambar and Medu vada.<p>
However, this varies greatly by region and personal taste, 
<p>it is also often served with kaara chutney (onion based) or spicy fish curries. The dry spice mixture podi is convenient while travelling.</p>

<p><b><em>Variations</em></b>
There are several regional variations of idlis made in South India and Sri Lanka.
<p>With the emigration of south Indians and Sri Lankans throughout the region and world, many variations on idli have been created in addition to the almost countless local variations.
<p>Hard-to-get ingredients and differing cooking customs have required changes in both ingredients and methods.
<p>Parboiled rice can reduce the soaking time considerably. 
<p>Store-bought ground rice or cream of rice may also be used.[15] Similarly, semolina or cream of wheat may be used for preparing rava idli (wheat idli).
<p>Dahi (yogurt) may be added to provide the sour flavour for unfermented batters. Pre-packaged mixes allow for almost instant idlis.[17]

<p>In addition to or instead of fenugreek other spices may be used such as<em> mustard seeds, chili peppers, cumin, coriander, ginger, 
<p>etc.</em>Sugar may be added to make them sweet instead of savoury. Idli may also be stuffed with a filling of <em>potato, beans, carrot and masala.</em>
<p>Leftover idlis can be cut-up or crushed and saut√©ed for a dish called idli upma.
<p>A microwave or an automatic electric steamer that is non-stick is considered to be a convenient alternative to conventional stovetop steamers.
<p>Batter preparation using a manual rocking rock grinder can be replaced by electric grinders or blenders.<p>
Many restaurants have also come up with fusion recipes of Idlis as idly manchurian,<em> idly fry, chilly idly, stuffed idly,</em> to name a few.</P>
