<h1> About Vada Pav</h1>
<p>Vada Pav is sold in shops, outside of schools and colleges all over Mumbai because it is so popular and loved by street food lovers.<p>

It is one of the most humble street foods in Mumbai, yet it is tasty and delicious.
Vada pav basically has Batata Vada which is sandwiched between two slices of a pav (fluffy dinner roll) topped with sweet chutney, green chutney, and dry garlic chutney.<p>
Batata vada are fried batter coated potato dumpling fritters. The batter is made with nutty gram flour (besan) and spices. The filling consist of savory, spiced mashed potatoes.<p>

Batata means potato in Marathi language. While the term vada mostly means a fried fritter or a fried dumpling-like savory dish.<p>

Throughout my childhood, I ate vada pav in many places in Mumbai and it was always so delicious! Even today I still make sure that I buy vada pav whenever I visit Mumbai. However,<p> 
when I am craving vada pav and canâ€™t get to Mumbai, so I make them at home.<p>

Pav means a small loaf or bun of bread in Indian and is the same as dinner rolls.<p>
They are made with all purpose flour or whole wheat flour and can be bought from bakeries, super stores and sweet shops in India.</P>
